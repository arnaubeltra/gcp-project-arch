# Practice architecture project

This project is designed to improve skills related to:

- Google Cloud Services
- Use of Terraform

## Storytelling

We are a company that works with Google Cloud, and we help our clients to deploy their on-premises infrastructures to the Public Cloud. In this case, we have to deploy an e-commerce webpage which has to be highly available for European clients, and must be scalable as we will have changing traffics.

The current application is built in a three layer architecture. We have a Frontend application that connects to a Backend, and a database to store all the application data.
